# **DeepRacer-For-Dummies - Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**

For the purposes of the `Deep Racer` Project, I elected to only install a `minimal` installation of `ubuntu 18.04 LTS` Desktop.

You can download the `18.04 LTS` Installation `iso image` from [https://ubuntu.com/#download](https://ubuntu.com/#download)

* I am running Ubuntu off of a 128GB Partition of my primary NVMe Drive that is shared with Windows.
* Using [these instructions](./docs/mount_drive.md), I mounted a 2TB HDD to my `~/git` folder, specifically to handle the data generated by training my AWS DeepRacer.
